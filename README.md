This plugin intends to support linting of ES2015+ (ES6+) import/export syntax, and prevent issues with misspelling of file paths and import names. All the goodness that the ES2015+ static module syntax intends to provide, marked up in your editor.

**IF YOU ARE USING THIS WITH SUBLIME**: see the [bottom section](#sublimelinter-eslint) for important info.

## Rules

* Ensure imports point to a file/module that can be resolved. ([`no-unresolved`](./docs/rules/no-unresolved.md))
* Ensure named imports correspond to a named export in the remote file. ([`named`](#named))
* Ensure a default export is present, given a default import. ([`default`](#default))
* Ensure imported namespaces contain dereferenced properties as they are dereferenced. ([`namespace`](#namespace))
* Report any invalid exports, i.e. re-export of the same name ([`export`](#export))

Helpful warnings:

* Report CommonJS `require` calls. ([`no-require`](#no-require))
* Report use of exported name as identifier of default export ([`no-named-as-default`](#no-named-as-default))
* Report repeated import of the same module in multiple places ([`no-duplicates`](#no-duplicates), warning by default)

Style rules:

* Ensure all imports appear before other statements ([`imports-first`](#imports-first))

## Installation

```sh
npm install eslint-plugin-import -g
```

or if you manage ESLint as a dev dependency:

```sh
# inside your project's working tree
npm install eslint-plugin-import --save-dev
```

As of v0.9, all rules are off by default. However, you may configure them manually
in your `.eslintrc`, or extend one of the canned base configs from the `eslint-config-import`
package:

```yaml
---
extends:
  - "eslint:recommended"
  - import/warnings  # after `npm i -D eslint-config-import`-ing

# or configure manually:
plugins:
  - import

rules:
  import/no-unresolved: [2, {commonjs: true, amd: true}]
  import/named: 2
  import/namespace: 2
  import/default: 2
  import/export: 2
  # etc...
```


# Rule Details



### `named`

Verifies that all named imports are part of the set of named exports in the referenced module.

For `export`, verifies that all named exports exist in the referenced module.

### `default`

If a default import is requested, this rule will report if there is no default
export in the imported module.

For [ES7], reports if a default is named and exported but is not found in the
referenced module.

### `namespace`

Enforces names exist at the time they are dereferenced, when imported as a full namespace (i.e. `import * as foo from './foo'; foo.bar();` will report if `bar` is not exported by `./foo`.).

Will report at the import declaration if there are _no_ exported names found.

Also, will report for computed references (i.e. `foo["bar"]()`).

Reports on assignment to a member of an imported namespace.

**Implementation note**: currently, this rule does not check for possible
redefinition of the namespace in an intermediate scope. Adherence to the ESLint
`no-shadow` rule for namespaces will prevent this from being a problem.

For [ES7], reports if an exported namespace would be empty (no names exported from the referenced module.)

### `no-require`

Reports `require([string])` function calls. Will not report if >1 argument,
or single argument is not a literal string.

Intended for temporary use when migrating to pure ES6 modules.

Given:
```js
// ./mod.js
export const foo = 'bar'
export function bar() { return foo }

// ./common.js
exports.something = 'whatever'
```

This would be reported:

```js
var mod = require('./mod')
  , common = require('./common')
  , fs = require('fs')
  , whateverModule = require('./not-found')
```

### `no-named-as-default`

Reports use of an exported name as the locally imported name of a default export.

Given:
```js
// foo.js
export default 'foo';
export const bar = 'baz';
```

...this would be valid:
```js
import foo from './foo.js';
```

...and this would be reported:
```js
// message: Using exported name 'bar' as identifier for default export.
import bar from './foo.js';
```

Rationale: using an exported name as the name of the default export is likely...

- *misleading*: others familiar with `foo.js` probably expect the name to be `foo`
- *a mistake*: only needed to import `bar` and forgot the brackets (the case that is prompting this)

For [ES7], this also prevents exporting the default from a referenced module as a name within than module, for the same reasons:

```js
// valid:
export foo from './foo.js'

// message: Using exported name 'bar' as identifier for default export.
export bar from './foo.js';
```

### `export`

Reports funny business with exports, such as

```js
export default class MyClass { /*...*/ } // Multiple default exports.

function makeClass() { return new MyClass(...arguments) }

export default makeClass // Multiple default exports.
```

or
```js
export const foo = function () { /*...*/ } // Multiple exports of name 'foo'.

function bar() { /*...*/ }
export { bar as foo } // Multiple exports of name 'foo'.
```

In the case of named/default re-export, all `n` re-exports will be reported,
as at least `n-1` of them are clearly mistakes, but it is not clear which one
(if any) is intended. Could be the result of copy/paste, code duplication with
intent to rename, etc.

### `no-duplicates`

Reports if a resolved path is imported more than once.

Valid:
```js
import SomeDefaultClass, * as names from './mod'
```

...whereas here, both `./mod` imports will be reported:

```js
import SomeDefaultClass from './mod'

// oops, some other import separated these lines
import foo from './some-other-mod'

import * as names from './mod'
```

The motivation is that this is likely a result of two developers importing different
names from the same module at different times (and potentially largely different
locations in the file.) This rule brings both (or n-many) to attention.

This rule is only set to a warning, by default.


### `imports-first`

By popular demand, this rule reports any imports that come after non-import
statments:

```js
import foo from './foo'

// some module-level initializer
initWith(foo)

import bar from './bar' // <- reported
```

Providing `absolute-first` as an option will report any absolute imports (i.e.
packages) that come after any relative imports:

```js
import foo from 'foo'
import bar from './bar'

import * as _ from 'lodash' // <- reported
```

This rule is disabled by default.

# Resolver plugins

With the advent of module bundlers and the current state of modules and module
syntax specs, it's not always obvious where `import x from 'module'` should look
to find the file behind `module`.

Up through v0.10ish, this plugin has directly used substack's [`resolve`] plugin,
which implements Node's import behavior. This works pretty well in most cases.

However, Webpack allows a number of things in import module source strings that
Node does not, such as loaders (`import 'file!./whatever'`) and a number of
aliasing schemes, such as [`externals`]: mapping a module id to a global name at
runtime (allowing some modules to be included more traditionally via script tags).

In the interest of supporting both of these, v0.11 introduces resolver plugins.
At the moment, these are modules exporting a single function:

```js

exports.resolveImport = function (source, file, config) {
  // return source's absolute path given
  // - file: absolute path of importing module
  // - config: optional config provided for this resolver

  // return `null` if source is a "core" module (i.e. "fs", "crypto") that
  // can't be found on the filesystem
}
```

The default `node` plugin that uses [`resolve`] is a handful of lines:

```js
var resolve = require('resolve')
  , path = require('path')
  , assign = require('object-assign')

exports.resolveImport = function resolveImport(source, file, config) {
  if (resolve.isCore(source)) return null

  return resolve.sync(source, opts(path.dirname(file), config))
}

function opts(basedir, config) {
  return assign( {}
               , config
               , { basedir: basedir }
               )
}
```

It essentially just uses the current file to get a reference base directory (`basedir`)
and then passes through any explicit config from the `.eslintrc`; things like
non-standard file extensions, module directories, etc.

Currently [Node] and [Webpack] resolution have been implemented, but the
resolvers are just npm packages, so third party packages are supported (and encouraged!).

Just install a resolver as `eslint-import-resolver-foo` and reference it as such:

```yaml
settings:
  import/resolver: foo
```

or with a config object:

```yaml
settings:
  import/resolver:
    foo: { someConfigKey: value }
```

# Settings

You may set the following settings in your `.eslintrc`:

#### `import/ignore`

A list of regex strings that, if matched by a path, will
not parse the matching module. In practice, this means rules other than
`no-unresolved` will not report on the `import` in question.

#### `import/resolver`

See [resolver plugins](#resolver-plugins).

#### `import/parser`

This setting allows you to provide a custom parser module, in the event your
project uses syntax not understood by Babel.

This plugin defaults to using Babylon, Babel's internal parser, but is also
compatible with Espree's AST. As long as the import nodes follow [ESTree],
any parser should work.

If you're using [babel-eslint] as ESLint's parser, you probably don't need to
specify it here (anymore, as of v0.9).

[custom parser]: https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/master/docs/user-guide/configuring.md#specifying-parser
[babel-eslint]: https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint
[ESTree]: https://github.com/estree/estree

#### `import/parse-options`

This setting will be merged 1-level deep (think `Object.assign`) with the default
parse options and passed as the second parameter to the parser: `parse(file, options)`.
See the [`import/es7-jsx`](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import/tree/master/config)
config file for an example of explicit parse options for Babylon.

Or, if you are using another parser, you may want to set these options as well.
(and maybe contribute another config file! i.e. `eslint-config-import/espree`)

Here is an example `.eslintrc` for reference:

```yaml

extends:
  - "eslint:recommended"
  - import/warnings  # optionally start from eslint-config-import

# if not using the `extends` package, make sure to add the plugin here:
plugins:
  - import

rules:
  import/default: 2
  import/no-unresolved: 1

settings:

  import/ignore:
    # any imported module path matching one of these patterns will not be parsed
    - 'node_modules' # this is the default, but must be included if overwritten
    - '\\.es5$'

  import/resolver: webpack # will use 'node' if not specified

  import/parser: esprima-fb  # default is 'babylon'. change if needed.
```

## SublimeLinter-eslint

Recently, SublimeLinter-eslint introduced a change to support `.eslintignore` files
which altered the way file paths are passed to ESLint when linting during editing.

See roadhump/SublimeLinter-eslint#58 for more details, but essentially, you may find
you need to add the following to a `.sublimelinterrc` file:

```json
{
  "linters": {
    "eslint": {
      "args": ["--stdin-filename", "@"]
    }
  }
}
```

I also found that I needed to set `rc_search_limit` to `null`, which removes the file
hierarchy search limit when looking up the directory tree for `.sublimelinterrc`:

In Package Settings / SublimeLinter / User Settings:
```json
{
  "user": {
    "rc_search_limit": null
  }
}
```

I believe this defaults to `3`, so you may not need to alter it depending on your
project folder max depth.
